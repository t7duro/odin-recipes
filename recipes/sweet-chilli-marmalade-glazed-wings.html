        <h2>Description</h2>
        It doesn't get much easier than these three-ingredient sticky sweet wings. A combination of orange marmalade and sweet chili sauce make for some of the most addictive wings you've ever had.

        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds chicken wing pieces, drumettes and flats</li>
            <li>½ cup orange marmalade</li>
            <li>¼ cup sweet chili sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Set a wire rack inside a large foil-lined rimmed baking sheet; arrange chicken wings on top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until wings are no longer pink at the bone and the skin is crispy, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix orange marmalade and chili sauce in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Add cooked wings to marmalade-chili sauce and toss until well coated. Plate wings and pour extra sauce on top.</li>
